# patric-triangles
Finding the number of triangles in a network is an important problem in the analysis of complex networks (Graphs). 

This is an MPI implementation of the algorithm presented in [1], for finding the *exact* number of triangles in massive networks, which is an improved version of PATRIC algorithm [2].
